##Issues

This file will collect issues that have still been unsolved in the relevant branch. They may range
from incomplete implementations to platform-specific issues and from buggy implementations to once-in-a-blue-moon thread deadlocks.

- Mac bug in JavaLaunchHelper known in 2017 versions of IntelliJ. Execution unaffected, but red output indicating errors can be seen in Terminal.

####MATLAB demo on matrix storage:

- For large arrays, might need to tweak the maximum array size through MATLAB's preferences (check source code comments)


#### Splay Trees:

- Have to debug the traversal methods.
